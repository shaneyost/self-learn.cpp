# self-learn.cpp

A growing collection of focused C++ experiments and sandbox projects. Each folder explores a 
specific C++ concept, feature, or best practice. 

The goal here is to biuld a journal while I learn (or relearn) these concepts. I need a place
where I can dump my thoughts and deepen my understanding of the language and its semantics.

That is all.
